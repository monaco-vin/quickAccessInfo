# quickAccessInfo

As a Manager, you are able to generate a webpage that displays your team's basic info
so that you have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

This is done through a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

Below is a walkthru demonstration of the deployed application showing passing file tests AND the html that is generated.
